\arguments{
\item{Municipalities}{character vector of length=length(Municipality) with names of basic spatial units.}

\item{Indicators}{character    vector of    length=length(Indicators)    with the names of all indicators included in the calculation.}

\item{FK_TrophicgroupID}{integer    vector of    length=length(Indicators) with trophic group IDs that the corresponding indicator belongs to.}

\item{Key.indicators}{logical    vector of    length=length(Indicators), indicating whether the corresponding indicator is a key indicator or not.}

\item{Fidelity}{numeric vector of length=length(Indicators)    with fidelities of each indicator to the major habitat in question.}

\item{Areaind.Name}{integer    vector of    length=length(Areaind.Name)    with unique indicator area IDs.}

\item{Areaind.Indicator}{character    vector of length=length(Areaind.Name)    with indicator names corresponding to the entries in Areaind.Name.}

\item{Area.Name}{integer    vector of length=length(Area.Name)    with indicator area IDs, where each indicator area ID is
repeated for each spatial unit it consist of.}

\item{Area.Municipality}{character        length=length(Area.Name)    vector of names of basic spatial units corresponding to the entries in Area.Name.}
}
\value{
Weights.trof numeric matrix of	dim=length(Municipality) x length(Indicators) Wi * Wf.
}
\description{
Calculates fidelity weights (Wi), trophic weights (Wf) and their product for each combination
of municipality and indicator.
}
\details{
Wi is the fidelity of indicator to ecosystem in questions divided by summed fidelity
of indicators belonging to the same trophic group occuring in a municipality.
Wf for non-key indicators equals 0.5/number of trophic groups observed in the municipality if also
key indicators are observed in the municipality, and 1/number of trophic groups observed in the municipality
if no key elements are observed in the municipality. Wf for key indicators equals 0.5 if also
non-key indicators are observed in the municipality, and 1 if only key indicators are observed.
Weights.trof : Matrix Double (N.kom x N.ind) Wi * Wf
