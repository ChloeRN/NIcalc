\title{Fit Probability Distributions to Indicator Observations}
\usage{
elicitate(expected.value = NULL, lower = NULL, upper = NULL,
  type.t = c("continuous"), prob.quant = c(0.25, 0.75))
}
\arguments{
\item{expected.value}{double, length =    n.obs, vector of the indicator
observations' expected values}

\item{lower}{double, length = n.obs, vector of the indicator observations'
lower quantiles (0.25 quartiles)}

\item{upper}{double, length = n.obs, vector of the indicator observations'
upper quantiles (0.75 quartiles)}

\item{type.t}{character, length = 1 or n.obs, vector of types of measurement
scales. Valid types are \code{"continuous"} and \code{"discrete"}. If
\code{"continuous"} a continuous model is fitted to the corresponding
indicator observation. If \code{"discrete"} a discrete model is fitted to the
observation. If \code{length(type.t)==1} all observations are interpreted to
be measured on eihter a \code{"continuous"}, which is the default, or
\code{"discrete"} scale.}

\item{prob.quant}{double, length = 2, quantiles supplied in \code{"lower"}
and \code{"upper"}. Default is the lower and upper quartiles.}
}
\value{
\code{elicitate} returns a data.frame with \code{dim = c(n.obs,4)},
consisting of the following vectors\cr \code{[[1]] $FK_DistID} character,
vector of names of fitted model distributions, i.e. one of
\code{c("LogNormal", "TruncNormal", "ZIExponential", "Weibull", "Gamma",
"Poisson", "NegBinom", "ZIP")} for each indicator observation.\cr
\code{[[2]] $mu} double, vector of first parameter of fitted model
distributions\cr \code{[[3]] $sig} double, vector of second parameter of
fitted model distributions\cr \code{[[4]] $ssq} double, vector of sum of
squared deviations between observed parameters and those of the fitted model
distributions.

\description{
\code{elicitate} fits probability distributions to
a set of non-negative indicator observations by selecting for
each observation the distribution among a predetermined set of
model distribution families that best fits the observation
according to the least square criterion.
}
\details{
The function presumes that indicator observations are each given as
three parameters of either a continuous or discrete probability distribution:
the expected value together with two quantiles. The two quantiles default to
the lower- and upper quartiles respectively, but may be set to other
quantiles using the argument \code{prob.quant}.

The predetermined set of continuous model distributions consists of
the truncated normal-, lognormal-, Weibull-, gamma-, and zero-inflated
exponential distribution. The predetermined set of discrete models is the
Poisson-, negative binomial-, and zero-inflated Poisson distribution
families.

\code{Expected.value}, \code{Lower} and \code{Upper} should be of equal
length.\cr For indicator observations and reference values with no
uncertainty the corresponding elements of \code{Expected.value},
\code{Lower}, and \code{Upper} should be equal.\cr Negative values in any of
\code{Expected.value}, \code{Lower}, and \code{Upper} are interpreted as
missing values and all corresponding output elements are set to \code{NA}.
If one of \code{Expected.value}, \code{Lower} and \code{Upper} is \code{NA},
all corresponding output elements are set to \code{NA}.

\code{elicitation} first try to fit a model distribution with a call to
function \code{\link{estim.fct}}. If this results in an error, it calls
\code{\link{estimlight.fct}} instead.

\code{elicitation} is a utility function adapted to the mathematical framework
for calculating the nature index.
