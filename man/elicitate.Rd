  lower = NULL,
  upper = NULL,
  type.t = c("continuous"),

\arguments{
\item{expected.value}{double, length =    n.obs, vector of the indicator
observations' expected values}

\item{lower}{double, length = n.obs, vector of the indicator observations'
lower quantiles (0.25 quartiles)}

\item{upper}{double, length = n.obs, vector of the indicator observations'
upper quantiles (0.75 quartiles)}

\item{type.t}{character, length = 1 or n.obs, vector of types of measurement
scales. Valid types are \code{"continuous"} and \code{"discrete"}. If
\code{"continuous"} a continuous model is fitted to the corresponding
indicator observation. If \code{"discrete"} a discrete model is fitted to the
observation. If \code{length(type.t)==1} all observations are interpreted to
be measured on either a \code{"continuous"}, which is the default, or
\code{"discrete"} scale.}

\item{prob.quant}{double, length = 2, quantiles supplied in \code{"lower"}
and \code{"upper"}. Default is the lower and upper quartiles.}

\value{
\code{elicitate} returns a data.frame with \code{dim = c(n.obs,4)},
consisting of the following vectors\cr \code{[[1]] $FK_DistID} character,
vector of names of fitted model distributions, i.e. one of
\code{c("LogNormal", "TruncNormal", "ZIExponential", "Weibull", "Gamma",
"Poisson", "NegBinom", "ZIP")}.\cr
\code{[[2]] $mu} double, vector, first parameter of fitted model
distributions\cr \code{[[3]] $sig} double, vector, second parameter of
fitted model distributions\cr \code{[[4]] $ssq} double, vector, sum of
squared deviations between observed parameters and model distribution
parameters.

\description{
\code{elicitate} fits probability distributions to
a set of non-negative indicator observations by selecting for
each observation the distribution among a predetermined set of
model distribution families that best fits the observation
according to the least square criterion.
}
\details{
The function presumes that indicator observations are each given as
three parameters of either a continuous or discrete probability distribution:
the expected value together with two quantiles. Quantiles default to
the lower- and upper quartiles respectively, but may be set to other
quantiles using the argument \code{prob.quant}.

The predetermined set of continuous model distributions consists of
the truncated normal-, lognormal-, Weibull-, gamma-, and zero-inflated
exponential. The predetermined set of discrete models is the
Poisson-, negative binomial-, and zero-inflated Poisson distribution
families.

Negative values in any of \code{Expected.value}, \code{Lower}, and
\code{Upper} are interpreted as missing values and all corresponding output
elements are set to \code{NA}.

\code{elicitation} is a utility function adapted to the mathematical framework
for calculating the nature index.
}
\seealso{
\code{elicitation} first tries to fit a model distribution with a call to
function \code{\link{estim}}. If this results in an error, it calls
\code{\link{estimlight}} instead.\cr
Function \code{\link{qdev}} calculates the sum of squares.
