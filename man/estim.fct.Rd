\title{Fit Probability Distribution to one Indicator Observation}
\usage{
estim.fct(obsval = NULL, proba = c(0.25, 0.75), type = "continuous")
}
\arguments{
\item{obsval}{double, length = 3, observed mean and quantiles in the sequence
\code{c(lower.quantile, mean, upper.quantile)}}

\item{proba}{double, length = 2, quantiles supplied in \code{"obsval"}.
Default is the lower and upper quartiles}

\item{type}{character, length = 1, type of measurement scales. Valid types
are \code{"continuous"} and \code{"discrete"}.
When \code{type = "continuous"}, a continuous model is fitted to the indicator
observation. When \code{type = "discrete"}, a discrete model is fitted.}
}
\value{
\code{estim.fct} returns a data.frame with \code{dim = c(1,4)},
consisting of the following vectors\cr \code{[[1]] $distrib} character,
selected family for model distribution, i.e. one of \code{c("Gamma",
"LogNormal", "TruncNormal", "Weibull", "ZIExponential", "NegBinom",
"Poisson", "ZIP")}. \cr \code{[[2]] $mu} double,
first parameter of fitted model distribution\cr \code{[[3]] $sig}
double, second parameter of fitted model distribution\cr
\code{[[4]] $crit} double, sum of squared deviations between observed
parameters and those of the fitted model distribution.
}
\description{
Function that selects, for both continuous and discrete cases and by using
the least square criterion, the distribution among a predetermined set of
model distribution families that best fits to an expected value and two
quantiles provided as arguments.
