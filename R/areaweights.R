#' Weighting for areas
#'
#'  Function that calculates relevant area weights (Wk) for chosen spatial resolution of the NI output.
#' I.e. areaweights.fct calculates Wk for a set of aggregated, nonoverlapping, spatial units each
#' consisting of one to many basic spatial units (municipalities).
#'
#' In the Norwegian implementation Wks are weights based on the area the major habitat in question covers
#' in each basic spatial unit. An alternative is to use the total area of the spatial unit, etc.
#' Wk is the relevant municipality area divided by the corresponding total area of the aggregate.
#' Municipalities outside the aggregate receive weights equal zero
#' Area weights are relevant when NI is calculated for aggregates of basic spatial units.
#'
#' The weights are stored in a three-dimensional array to be included in the calculation of the nature index in
#' a subsequent call to NIcalculation.fct.
#' In the array weights are repeated for each indicator included in the current calculation of NI.
#'
#'
#' @param Municipalities	character		length=length(Municipality)	vector of names of basic spatial units
#' @param Regions		character		length=length(Municipality)	vector of names of aggregated spatial units that the corresponding municipality is a part of.
#' @param Area.municipality	double		length=length(Municipality)	vector of relevant basic spatial unit areas
#' @param Indicators		character		length=length(Indicators)	vector of the names of all indicators included in the calculation
#'
#' @return Weights.reg.area	double array	dim=length(Municipality) x length(Indicators) x length(unique(Regions)) array of area weights.
