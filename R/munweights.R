#' Weighting for municipalities
#'
#' Calculates fidelity weights (Wi), trophic weights (Wf) and their product for each combination
#' of municipality and indicator.
#'
#' Wi is the fidelity of each indicator to each ecosystem, divided by the summed fidelity
#' of indicators belonging to the same trophic group occuring in a municipality.
#' Wf for non-key indicators equals 0.5/number of trophic groups observed in the municipality if also
#' key indicators are observed in the municipality, and 1/number of trophic groups observed in the municipality
#' if no key elements are observed in the municipality. Wf for key indicators equals 0.5 if also
#' non-key indicators are observed in the municipality, and 1 if only key indicators are observed.
#' Weights.trof : Matrix Double (N.kom x N.ind) Wi * Wf
#'
#' @param Municipalities	character vector of length=length(Municipality) with names of basic spatial units.
#' @param Indicators		character	vector of	length=length(Indicators)	with the names of all indicators included in the calculation.
#' @param FK_TrophicgroupID	integer	vector of	length=length(Indicators) with trophic group IDs that the corresponding indicator belongs to.
#' @param Key.indicators	logical	vector of	length=length(Indicators), indicating whether the corresponding indicator is a key indicator or not.
#' @param Fidelity		numeric vector of length=length(Indicators)	with fidelities of each indicator to the major habitat in question.
#' @param Areaind.Name	integer	vector of	length=length(Areaind.Name)	with unique indicator area IDs.
#' @param Areaind.Indicator character	vector of length=length(Areaind.Name)	with indicator names corresponding to the entries in Areaind.Name.
#' @param Area.Name		integer	vector of length=length(Area.Name)	with indicator area IDs, where each indicator area ID is
#' repeated for each spatial unit it consist of.
#' @param Area.Municipality character		length=length(Area.Name)	vector of names of basic spatial units corresponding to the entries in Area.Name.
#'
#' @return Weights.trof numeric matrix of	dim=length(Municipality) x length(Indicators) Wi * Wf.
